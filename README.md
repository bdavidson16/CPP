# CPP

This repository is a collection of C++ assignments that I have done throughout my courses. I have tried my best to organize them by project.

My main focus is becoming a Data Engineer, and hopefully Data Scientist. Therefore, my daily tasks do not involve and I feel that I have learned so much since completing these projects. However, I think these are a great example, and reminder to myself, of where I started and how far I have come as (1) a student finishing college and (2) a soon-to-be Data Engineer. Its crazy to see how simple these projects are compared to those that I am working on and it feels like its been years since completing these with the amount of work that I have since accomplished.

Thank you for listening to my tangent...
