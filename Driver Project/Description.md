This was one of the very first coding projects I ever had to do for school. I was so anxious, confused, worried, intrigued, and overall nervous for it to turn out perfect. I spent so much time on this project...

Looking back, it is a very simple mutator, accessor project that simply taught us about securing your code when needed. Now, I could easily have knocked this out in about an hour. Then, it took so long for me to even think about what I was really doing. It puts a lot of things in perspective and really makes me proud about how far I have come. 

I am tempted to go in and clean it up as well as add on to it. However, I do love looking at it as my first project.
